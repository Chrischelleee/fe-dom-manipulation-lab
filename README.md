# The Javascript Squares Challenge

In this lab, you'll be using Javascript to manipulate the DOM of a basic page with red squares. 

Good luck!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and then open up `index.html` to see the current state of the site and the instructions for each part of the challenge. In `script.js`, write your jQuery code to get the squares to change based on the instructions!

You may not modify the index.html page, but can add to `style.css` and `script.js`
